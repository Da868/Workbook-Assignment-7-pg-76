# Workbook-Assignment-7-pg-76

This workbook assignment was to change the labels from studnet names to student school year. I was able to change the label by first adding the column in the Gradelist, then setting the df.set_index = to df2. I was able to plot the graph with the updated labels from Names to Status.
